A) When looking at the order quantities column, most transactions are for 1,2,3 pairs of sneakers. There are outliers though that have orders for 2000 pairs. When considering this stark contrast, we need to use the median to ensure these outliers do not significantly alter the “average” we are looking for.
B) I would report the median value of an order, as this will show what most order amounts are for without having outliers significantly influence the statistic.
C) The median order amount is 284.0

# Question 1
import pandas as pd

dataset = pd.read_csv('shopify.csv')

print(dataset.head()) # see what the column names are

print(dataset['order_amount'].mean()) # get the "incorrect" answer
print(dataset['order_amount'].median()) # get our accurate answer

A) 
SELECT COUNT(o.ShipperID)
FROM Shippers AS s 
    JOIN Orders AS o ON o.ShipperID = s.ShipperID
WHERE s.ShipperName = "Speedy Express";

Total Orders Shipped: 54

B)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderID) AS "Orders", o.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeID, e.LastName
FROM Orders o , Employees e
JOIN Employees ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
GROUP BY o.EmployeeID 
ORDER BY Orders DESC
LIMIT 1;

Peacock has the most orders at 40

C)
SELECT p.ProductName
FROM Products AS p
    JOIN OrderDetails AS od ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
    JOIN Orders AS o ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
    JOIN Customers AS c ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.Country = "Germany"
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY SUM(od.Quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1;

The most ordered product in Germany is Boston Crab meat
