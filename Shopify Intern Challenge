A) When looking at the order quantities column, most transactions are for 1,2,3 pairs of sneakers. There are outliers though that have orders for 2000 pairs. When considering this stark contrast, we need to use the median to ensure these outliers do not significantly alter the “average” we are looking for.
B) I would report the median value of an order, as this will show what most order amounts are for without having outliers significantly influence the statistic.
C) The median order amount is 284.0

# Question 1
import pandas as pd

dataset = pd.read_csv('shopify.csv')

print(dataset.head()) # see what the column names are

print(dataset['order_amount'].mean()) # get the "incorrect" answer
print(dataset['order_amount'].median()) # get our accurate answer

A) 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT OrderID) AS "Total Orders Shipped" FROM Orders 

Total Orders Shipped: 196

B)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderID) AS "Orders", o.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeID, e.LastName
FROM Orders o , Employees e
JOIN Employees ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
GROUP BY o.EmployeeID 
ORDER BY Orders DESC

Peacock has the most orders at 40

C)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT od.OrderID) AS "Orders", p.ProductName
FROM Orders o , OrderDetails od, Customers c, Products p
JOIN Orders ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
JOIN Customers ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID AND c.Country = "Germany"
JOIN Products ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY Orders DESC

The most ordered product in Germany is Gorgonzola Telino
